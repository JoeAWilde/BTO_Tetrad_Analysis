        "After release pheasants *Phasianus colchicus* can disperse into the wider environment with management trying to slow down this diffusion beyond the bounds of the shoot. Protected areas might be sites that dispersing pheasants are attracted too due to respite from shooting and suitable habitat for overwintering and/or breeding. Using tetrad survey data from the BTO bird atlas from 2007-2011 we can assess whether there are relative movements of pheasants towards tetrads with high protected area coverage between the winter and breeding season in four counties. We used a generalised linear mixed effects model to examine the relationships between relative pheasant abundance and protected area coverage. We found varying results between the four counties but no strong evidence in any county that there was a net movement of pheasants into tetrads with higher protected area coverage. In fact we found the opposite in two counties (Cornwall and Devon) with signs of relative shifts in pheasants abundance towards tetrads with lower protected area coverage. There are a number of important caveats to this work that we highlight at the end of this report, including the use of coarse categorical data, spatial autocorrelation in the model and the assumption of constant survival within counties.\n",

        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Pheasants are released across the UK for shooting during the winter months. After release, pheasants can move away from the release sites with game management (e.g. supplementary feeders and walking-in) aiming to keep the majority of pheasants within areas where shooting will take place. Outside of the shooting area, protected areas may provide attractive areas for dispersing individuals to move into and because they may provide refuge from shooting activities or provide suitable wintering/breeding territories. One way to assess whether released pheasants are preferentially moving into protected areas would be to examine whether there are relative shifts in the abundance of Pheasants towards protected areas from the point of release.\n",
        "\n",
        "During 2007-2011 the BTO organised volunteer surveys of all birds during the winter and breeding periods. This survey data is recorded at the tetrad level (2kmx2km squares) across the UK and contains data on gamebirds, including Pheasants. This data allows pheasant abundance to be compared between winter, when shooting typically takes place, and summer, when breeding takes place but the next batch of reared pheasants have not yet been released. Between these two time periods the number of pheasants will have decreased overall (due to natural mortality and shooting) and therefore we are interested in changes in the relative abundance. If pheasants are redistributing towards protected areas then we would expect increases in the relative abundance between winter and summer in tetrads with higher protected area coverage.\n",

        "For each of the tetrads (n = 3442) across the four counties examined we determined the proportion of the 2x2km squares that were covered by any type protected area (see Figure 2) and by each of the habitat classes. The UK CEH land cover data set contains 21 habitat categories but we used a simplified version that contained the following 8 habitat categories: broadleaf woodland, coniferous woodland, arable, improved grassland, mountain/uplands, saltwater, coastal and built up. We also calculated the Shannon diversity index for habitats in each tetrad with higher index values relating to more diverse and varied habitats within the tetrad.\n",

        "### Statistical Modelling\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior to carrying out statistical modelling the abundance data had to be standardised across counties since it was recorded differently for each county. Abundance data were continuous for Cornwall and remained unaltered for modelling. For Devon, Berkshire and Hertfordshire abundance was categorical and these categories were also different for each of the three counties. Therefore we used the midpoint value for each category for use in statistical modelling. Therefore each tetrad had a single continuous value of abundance for winter (Figure 3) and in summer (Figure 4).\n",

        "\n",
        "We then converted all of these continuous abundance measures into an abundance measure that was relative to the total number of pheasants. This was done by diving the abundance for a given tetrad by the total abundance for all tetrads in the same country and during the same season (winter or summer). This relative abundance metric was chosen to model with since it takes into account the mortality between winter and summer meaning that relative abundance would be constant for a given tetrad if there is no net immigration or emigration and if survival is constant across the county.\n",
        "\n",
        "To model relative abundance as a function of covariates we used a tweedie generalised linear mixed effects models with a log link function. The tweedie distribution is used for data that are right-skewed, positive and contain zeros meaning gaussian and gamma distributions can not be used [@kurz2017]. Fixed covariates in the model were protected area coverage (continuous value from 0-1), season (two-level category: winter or summer), county (four-level category: Berkshire, Cornwall, Devon and Hertfordshire) and the proportional habitat coverage of eight different habitat (separate continuous value from 0-1 for: broadleaf woodland, coniferous woodland, arable, improved grassland, mountain/uplands, saltwater, coastal and built up). An interaction term was fit between protected area coverage, season and county to allow the relationship between relative abundance and protected area coverage to vary between seasons and counties. To incorporate the dependency between observations from the same tetrad, we used the unique tetrad ID as a random intercept.\n",
        "\n",
        "We predict that the relationship (intercept and slope) between relative abundance and protected area coverage will be the same for winter and summer if there is no net movement of pheasants in relation to the protected area coverage of a tetrad. If there is a net movement of pheasants into tetrads with higher protected area coverage between winter and summer then we expect that the relative pheasant abundance will be higher in summer compared to winter at higher protected area coverage.\n",

        "\n",
        "The relationships between relative pheasant abundance and protected area coverage varied between seasons and counties (Figure 5). For Berkshire the regression lines between relative abundance and protected area coverage did not significantly differ between winter and summer (in terms of intercept and slope). For Cornwall the regression lines between relative abundance and protected area coverage differed significantly between winter and summer (in terms of both intercept and slope). The intercept was higher in summer and the slope more negative compared to winter. For Devon the regression lines between relative abundance and protected area coverage differed significantly between winter and summer in terms of intercept but not slope. The intercept was higher for summer compared to to winter. For Hertfordshire the regression lines between relative abundance and protected area coverage differed significantly between winter and summer in terms of both intercept but not slope. The intercept was higher summer and the slope was less negative in summer but the p-value was near the threshold value of 0.05 (p = 0.049) and therefore there is weak evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "With regards to habitats there were significant positive relationships between relative abundance and the proportion of the tetrad covered by broad leafed woodland, arable, coastal and improved grassland (variables arranged with largest parameters estimate first). On the other hand there was a significant negative relationships between abundance and the proportion of uplands and built up areas. The proportion of coniferous woodland, saltwater, freshwater and habitat diversity did not have significant relationships with relative abundance.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   **Midpoints of Categorical Variables:** For Devon, Berkshire and Hertfordshire we had to take the midpoint of abundance categories (e.g. 1-5 birds). This means that increases in abundance within the same category result in no change in abundance but that even small increases at the extremes of a category can results in a large increase in abundance as the value increases to a higher category\n",
        "-   **Spatial Autocorrelation:** there was evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of the model. This violates one of the core assumptions of the model, that the residuals are independent and identically distributed. This can bias parameter estimates and inflate type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect) [@f.dormann2007].\n",
        "-   **Defining Attraction:** in this type of analysis it would be hard to differentiate between attraction of pheasants to protected areas and random dispersal of pheasants away from release sites that results in pheasants moving into protected area. Such a differentiation is of little consequence to these analysis as we find no large shifts in pheasant abundance in relation to protected area coverage and would be better suited to an individual-level analysis\n",
        "-   **Surveys 10+ years ago:** The surveys for the BTO bird atlas were conducted between 2007 and 2011 and while the behavior of released pheasants is unlikely to have changed a lot since this period it is worth highlighting that this analysis represents movement of pheasants from more than 12 years ago\n",
